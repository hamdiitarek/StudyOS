Quiz:

PART '1'
- Create 3 folders (dir1, dir2, and dir3).
- at the same place Create 3 files (file1, file2, and file3).
- enter dir2 and create 3 files (file1, file2, and file3).

- Enter file1 and type (40 newline 200 newline 1000 newline 3)
- Sort numbers in file1 NUMERICALLY and make the sorted data overwite the unsorted data in the file
- Display the sorted content of file1 using cli

- Without opening file3 type your name in it.
- Using new command and Without overwiting file3 type your id in a newline in the same file.
- Display the content of the file

- Now display ONLY number of lines in file3.

- find all the files start with the letter 'f' Only in the current directory.
- go to home
- find all the files named 'file1' in your directory and their sub-directories.
- find all files include your name inside it in the your directory and sub-directories (ONLY PRINT FILE NAMES).
=======================================================================
PART '2': Program using Shell & C
- Implement a C program that receives 6 parameters (subject1, its grade, subject2, its grade, subject3, and its grade) then
return each subject and in front of it its percentage (user's grade * 100)/60 then print user's total degrees, and user's total percentage
(user's total grades * 100)/60
BUT NOTICE these IMPORTANT NOTES:
	1. The main function must receive its 6 parameters through CLI NOT using scanf and CLI must receive the 6 parameters from the user.
	2. Prompt the user using shell like (Enter the first subject, then receive it, then Enter the grade of the first subject and so on)
	3. Validate the user's answers, which means if the user enter a number larger than 60 returns (Invalid input) and terminate program.
	4. Finally make the output of your C program (SYSTEM COMMAND) named 'cool', which means wherever I am standing in my OS
and say 'cool' without using any path, my program executes.
like this:
>>cool
>> Enter your first subject:
>> math
>> Enter degree of the first subject MAX 60:
>> 50
>> Enter your second subject
